# Group 24 - Therapy Connections
![example workflow](https://github.com/ubc-cpsc455-2024S/project-24_OkTherapy/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

## App description

Our project will be a web app that matches individuals in BC seeking therapy to potential therapists based on their needs.  The aim of this web app is to make the process of finding a therapist more accessible and less overwhelming, and facilitate the process of connecting with a therapist. User data collected from a questionnaire will be used to identify compatible therapists from a database of BC therapists generated by scraping data from [BC Counselling](https://counsellingbc.com/counsellors/). Time permitting, we plan to add an email feature that allows users to communicate with their matched therapists and the ability for therapists to customize their profile information.

## Project task requirements

### Minimal requirements (will definitely complete)
As a new user I can register an account for the website so I can use the functionalities of the website. <br>

As a user I want to login to my account so that I can securely access my personal information. <br>

As a user I want to fill out my profile with personal information so that I can be well matched based on my needs:
- Generate form questions based on common therapist specialties and areas of practice 
- Create a front-end form
- Create an API endpoint that creates a user profile and saves the data to the database
- Create a database schema <br>

As a user I want to be matched to therapists to narrow down my search:
- Scrape therapist profiles from https://counsellingbc.com/counsellors
- Create a script to populate the DB with scraped data
- Create an API endpoint to retrieve therapist profiles
- Create an algorithm to filter and rank therapists from the database according to user preferences
- Create a front-end that displays the matched therapists


### Standard requirements (will most likely complete)
As a user I want to be able to browse through therapists profiles that I’ve been matched with to find the one that best suits my needs. <br>

As a user I want to edit my profile information after creation to reflect my changing needs. <br>

As a user, I want to be able to see my matched therapists as long as I’m logged in (can be different sessions). <br>

### Stretch requirements (plan to complete at least 1)
As a user I want to send an email to a therapist from the website so that I can easily communicate with the therapist.<br>

As a therapist, I want to edit my profile information to ensure that it’s accurate. <br>
